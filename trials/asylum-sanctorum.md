        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This trial shares it's difficulty scaling mechanic with Cloudrest whereby you can choose to kill the bosses in any order you want (there is no additional "trash" enemies).  Heading to the last boss room, which is situated straight ahead as you enter the trial, before killing the side bosses will cause the remaining boss/es to join in the final boss fight with you.  The difficulty of the trial is judged by how many additional bosses you take into the last boss fight; one additional boss denotes a +1 difficulty, two additional bosses denotes a +2 difficulty (Cloudrest has three side bosses so has an additional +3 difficulty).</p>
        <p>As you can imagine the difficulty jumps up quite considerably when you have to deal with multiple bosses.  We will look at each bosses mechanics in detail and give general details on the final boss fight for each difficulty level.</p>

        <h2>Boss One - Saint Llothis the Pious</h2>
        <p>Once the majority of the enemies have been disposed of the boss will spawn in the little alcove with the torches.  While a lot more manageable today, this boss still gives a lot of players trouble due to the infamous "Popcorn" mechanic.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Quake</b> - The "Popcorn" mechanic happens when the boss looks up and appears to scream.  Three players will be targeted by this attack and will each have a fast spreading AoE under their feet, three times in a row.  Each time the circle reaches its full size anyone caught inside will be thrown into the air and receive a fair amount of damage.  This can target the tank as well.</li>
          <li><b>Enraged Slam</b> - A huge AoE spreads out from beneath the bosses feet and hits everyone inside once it reaches its full size which will do a lot of damage if not blocked.  Everyone inside will be affected by a bleed that does not clear until your health reaches full.</li>
          <li><b>Portal</b> - A large, black circle with a vague green outline is dropped on a random group member.  Standing in this circle ports you to another area where you are greeted by The Serpents Image.  This mini boss doesn't do anything fancy: applies a poison and has a frontal cleave.  If The Serpents Image is not killed in 100s the Mantikora will enrage.</li>
          <li><b>Spear Throw</b> - The boss throws a spear up into the air which will target the furthest player away from the boss with a large AoE that does a lot of poison damage to anyone inside.  These remain on the ground for a long time.</li>
          <li><b>Enrage</b> - When the boss reaches ~10% health it will enrage and start hitting a lot harder.</li>
        </ul>

          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>Have your main tank taunt and turn the boss away from the group (you have a bit more room for this fight if you move the boss over towards the entrance ramp).  The group should spread out evenly forming a semi circle around the boss.  A healer and two ranged damage dealers can stay at range to kite and position the "Piercing Spears" away from the group.  If your kiters start on one side they can simply move in one direction together each time a spear is thrown (try to position these as close together, overlapping them as much as possible).</p>
            <p>When the boss does its scream everyone can begin kiting the "Quake" attack by running backwards to ensure it is taken away as quickly as possible.  If it is on you keep running backwards for two hits, when the third circle appears dodge roll forwards and get back in position.  If it is not on you simply return to your position.</p>
            <p>The main tank can be targeted by the "Quake" mechanic.  If this happens you either need to focus heals on the tank and have them stay still and take the damage (this allows you to keep the boss still) or your tank deals with it the same as everyone else and repositions the boss as best they can afterwards.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the second "Quake" attack a portal will spawn.  You can spread out for this early to avoid too many group members getting ported away if needed.  Your off tank should jump in here to grab and turn the mini boss.  One or two damage dealers (or more if needed, this depends on your group damage) should jump into the portal and kill the mini boss.  While the mini boss is alive the Mantikore will not do her "Quake" mechanic.</p>
            <p>This boss can be overtaunted by a single player so your tank should only apply their taunt when it needs to be refreshed.</p>
            <p><b>Tip:</b> If you have enough damage in your group you do not need to kill the mini boss downstairs.  The portal mechanic is incredibly fast so it's likely at least one group member will be transported, however, so your off tank should be ready to jump in and help.  The benefit of this is that the upstairs players do not have to deal with the "Quake" mechanic for the rest of the fight.  While trying this initially you can send a damage dealer into the portal and bring the mini boss to ~10% health.  If the Mantikora is still alive after 90s then kill the mini boss quickly.</p>

        <h2>Bridge Approach</h2>
        <p>If you are wanting to do the "Feeding Pit" achievement then visit the small cave towards the back left of the room and grab some meat.  Continue up the ramp behind where the boss spawned (to the right) and into the next room.  Each encounter from here on will consist of the same selection of elite enemies (explained below).  Once the room is clear you can head out and down the stairs towards the bridge killing the group on enemies that runs in.  Make your way across the bridge, killing everything that spawns in and being very careful of the broken areas leaving large holes that you can fall down.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Overcharger</b> - Ranged enemies that will cause random members of the group to become "Overcharged"; inflicting them with a large red AoE under their feet which moves with them and causes a lot of damage to anyone standing in it.  They also target group members with a continuous lightning attack which will spawn smaller, spreading red circles under the players feet and damage inflict damage if the player does not move out when they reach full size.</li>
          <li><b>Troll</b> - Melee enemies that will throw rocks at random players, pound the ground dealing damage to anyone caught in the circle around them and throw poison on multiple players at a time.  The poison shows as a green glow and an AoE around the players feet which will spread to any other player it touches.</li>
          <li><b>Serpent Fang</b> - An archer with a frontal cone ability and an interruptible, charged-up shot that deals a lot of damage.</li>
          <li><b>War Priest</b> - Barely notable but the last of the bannered enemies here.  They are melee enemies with a snare and knockdown ability but do little damage.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spoiler">

          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>The group should spread out a little to avoid stacking the poison and "Overcharged".  Anyone affected by "Overcharged" should remain still and block cast while everyone else steps away from them and out of their AoE.  Healers may need to focus some heals on these players.  Any player with the smaller red lightning circles under their feet should kite (keep moving) to avoid the damage, both of these attacks can target the same player at the same time.</p>
            <p>Prioritise the Overchargers always, then the Trolls and finally the Archers and the War Priests.  The Archers should be interrupted when they charge up their "Taking Aim" attack and the group should remain still for a few seconds after the enemies are all dead to let the poison dissipate (don't expect this to happen in most groups, however, as the poison is quickly re-applied and it can be healed through).</p>
            <p>If you can heal through the Trolls ground slam then maintain your positions and keep up the damage.  Otherwise, make sure you organise well to be able to get out of the AoEs where needed.</p>
