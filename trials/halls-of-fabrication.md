        <h2>Initial Enemies</h2>
        <p>A winding path splits and takes you through the initial area.  You'll need to clear a few enemy waves before finding the first boss room.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Kagouti Fabricants</b> - Melee enemies that perform a "Charge" ability, indicated by a rectangular AoE.</li>
          <li><b>Shalk Fabricants</b> - Small melee enemies that don't pose much of a threat.  Their attacks are mainly single target but they do have poison and fire attacks.</li>
          <li><b>Refabricated Arquebus</b> - Spawned by the dead centurion, these are ranged enemies that have a few channeled abilities; the nastiest of which "Shock Barrage" can be interrupted.  These will do a fair amount of damage to all group members especially if they are not interrupted quickly.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spoiler">

          <div class="spoiler-head">Strategies</div>
          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>Typically, groups will run past the initial enemies to where the first Refabricated Arquebus' (a.k.a Spheres) spawn and the tanks will try to group everything up.  It helps to have one tank taunt the Spheres (ranged) and one tank taunt the Kagoutis and smaller adds (melee).  This way the tank with the ranged adds can get out of their line of sight and group them up efficiently while the tank with the melee adds can simply move them into the stack.</p>
            <p>The group should spread out a little, be ready to help interrupt the spheres and burn everything down when it is grouped up.  The spheres will attack random group members so lots of healing is required but a lot of damage can be mitigated by not stacking directly on top of each other.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section" data-description="two">
        <h2>Boss One - The Hunter Killers</h2>
        <p>Possibly the toughest first boss of any trial in this game even after a nerf to some of their abilities.  The bosses themselves have exactly the same attacks and don't pose a major threat to the group on their own (although the tanks can take considerable damage) but the Refabricated Spheres that spawn continuously throughout the fight are especially nasty.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Shock Lash</b> - The boss whips its tail at the tank causing a small amount of damage.  Small shock balls spread out and away from behind the boss and do damage to anyone they hit.</li>
          <li><b>Charged Gore</b> - A nasty bleed that applies a healing debuff which can be purged.  This will only hit whoever has aggro so should always be on the tanks.</li>
          <li><b>Residual Static</b> - Whoever has aggro will get an AoE lightning field placed under their feet which does a lot of damage.</li>
          <li><b>Lightning Lunge</b> - The bosses telegraphed, heavy attack.  If this is not blocked then the targeted player (whoever has aggro) will be pinned to the ground and another group member will need to interrupt the boss to release the pinned player before they die.</li>
          <li><b>Rending Leap</b> - When the player with aggro moves too far from the boss it leaps to them causing minor damage.</li>
          <li><b>Enrage</b> - When the bosses get too close together they will be linked by an electric beam that enrages them both and they will do a lot more damage.  This enraged mechanic also happens to the remaining boss when the other is killed.</li>
          <li><b>Refabricated Spheres</b> - These will randomly spawn throughout the fight on the circular pads around the middle of the room accompanied by a huge shield.  They only have two attacks but both can cause major problems:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Venom Burst</b> - A poison DoT that will hit group members and ramps up in damage.  This is purgable but will be a consistent source of damage for the whole group throughout the entire fight.</li>
              <li><b>Taking Aim</b> - An interruptible, charged shot that can be dodged.  This is aimed at a random group member and will likely one-shot anyone targeted that isn't a tank.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Shalk Fabricants</b> - These will spawn in when the bosses combined health reaches 75%, 50% and 25%.  They will do a fair amount of damage on top of everything else so can cause issues if they are alive for a long time.</li>
        </ul>

          <div class="spoiler-head">Strategies</div>
          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>There are multiple ways to handle this fight but below are two common strategies.  The first is more of a beginner/safe strat that is likely required when group DPS is low.  The second is very difficult to pull off if the group is not using an add-on (alerting them of when to dodge the "taking aim" attack) or if group DPS is low.  Either strat will require a lot of healing and a lot of purges, both healers and tanks should slot and use purge frequently where possible (sets such as Winters Respite, for more healing, and Curse Eater, free purges, can help here).  Tanks will need to block the heavy attack, purge themselves of the DoT and move out of the dropped lightning field ASAP.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The group stacks up in the middle while the tanks taunt one boss each and tank their boss on opposite sides of the room.  The group focuses one boss until it is at about 15% health and then switches to the other boss in order to kill them both at a similar time and keep the enrage to a minimum.  At least one damage dealer should slot a ranged interrupt and focus on interrupting the Spheres but these will need to be the top priority for damage throughout the fight regardless.  The shalks should also be killed ASAP when they spawn as they can cause major issues for the tanks if they choose to focus them.  The tanks will need to communicate well here, calling which Sphere they are going to focus next.  The tank holding the boss that is being damaged should stack close to the called Sphere (allowing the boss to take some cleave damage while the group focuses the sphere) while the other tank brings their boss close enough to spawn the electric beam through the Sphere (this is a very quick way to destroy the shields).  Once the shield for that Sphere is down then they should re-position in the same way on the next one (moving around the room so that the beam is never spawned through the group).</li>
              <li>The group stacks closer to the entrance and one tank brings one boss close to the group, turning it to the side.  When the lightning field is dropped the tank can simply rotate the boss 90Â° ready for the next one.  The other tank can take the other boss towards the far side of the room (a little past the centre) and dance with it until the focussed boss is nearly dead.  Their job will be to interrupt as many Spheres as possible while keeping their boss away.  The group remains stacked throughout the fight, only moving to dodge the "taking aim" attack from the Spheres when required.  One healer can move closer to the centre of the room to force the boss to target them with the lightning attack from the tail swipe rather than this all going straight through the group.  When the boss is on low health the second tank can bring their boss a little closer to allow the first tank to taunt it then this one can be focussed down in the same way.  The second tank is now free to focus purely on the interrupts but do not expect these to all be caught (there will be far too many at this stage).  The kite healer can now rejoin the group as the second tank will be assuming this role from their new position.</li>

      <div class="section" data-description="three">
        <h2>Boss Two - Pinnacle Factotum</h2>
        <p>After a small pack of enemies the second boss will spawn in the middle of the room.  As with most fights in this instance there is a lot of lightning AoE damage, stuns and magicka drain to deal with.  After this fight a teleportation beam will appear in the middle of the room which grants access to the next area.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Lightning Strike</b> - The bosses light attack.</li>
          <li><b>Shocking Smash</b> - The boss will twirl his staff around and slam whoever has aggro with it, this is his heavy attack.  After the slam several lightning sparks (Shockwave) will spread from the point of impact, stunning anyone they hit.</li>
          <li><b>Direct Current</b> - The boss will charge up a lightning attack on several members of the group (I believe four are targeted).  The boss will be linked to these players with a beam of lightning and red circles will start spreading under each players feet which will hit for considerable damage when they reach their full size (Overcurrent).  This attack is interruptible.</li>
          <li><b>Flux Burst</b> - The boss will jump to a player (usually the furthest away) and leave a large, lingering AoE circle where he landed.</li>
          <li><b>Simulacra</b> - The boss will disappear and four transparent clones will encircle whoever has aggro (we will assume this is the tank), where they are standing will be a green (safe) zone whereas the rest of the arena will be red.  One by one, the clones will turn opaque and attack the tank with a powerful, conal attack (Palm Strike).  If the tank manages to face the active clone and successfully block the attack it is stopped and only injures the tank.  These attacks start at 75% and will happen continuosly throughout the fight.</li>
          <li><b>Shock Wave</b> - The boss will target a random group member and perform a conal strike, dealing damage and staggering anyone caught inside.</li>
          <li><b>Unstable Energy (Meteors)</b> - Not 100% on the name for this one but members of the group will be targeted with multiple meteors (AoEs) that land where they are standing dealing a fair amount of damage.</li>
          <li><b>Conduits</b> - Randomly spawn throughout the fight once the boss is under 60% health and will do a little damage whilst draining a lot of magicka from anyone they target.</li>
          <li><b>Refabricated Centurions</b> - Two types of centurion will spawn continuosly through the fight; until the boss reaches 40% health these will all have the same mechanics:  If the player with aggro is too far from the centurion they will perform a spinning attack towards that player and periodically they will perform a "Pressure Release" attack which will cause a conal AoE in two directions from them at a time (alternating between forwards/backwards and left/right).  This attack will apply a stacking debuff which will greatly reduce your healing received.  After 40% another centurion can also spawn which will only perform the spinning attack mentioned above.</li>
          <li><b>Upstairs</b> - Four portals on the sides of the room will activate and can be utilised with the synergy button to transport a player upstairs.  Once upstairs the platform you are teleported to will shortly disappear and you will have four Refabricated Spheres to kill, each with a button behind them.  Once all four spheres have been killed the buttons need to be pressed simultaneously in order to stop the mechanics (you have 60 seconds and if this is not stopped it will wipe the group).</li>
        </ul>

          <div class="spoiler-head">Strategies</div>
          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>With a new tank it is recommended that the boss is tanked towards the back of the room in order to practice/deal with the Simulacra mechanic.  With the boss further back the group can run to the entrance when the boss disappears (indicating the start of the mechanic) and will be out of range of the conal attack if the tank is not able to block it correctly.  The tank will need to remain still but quickly turn to face each clone as it activates and block while facing it (a bash/taunt is a quick and easy way to turn your character in the right direction).  If your tank/group is more experienced the group can move out of the way of these attacks as they see the clones activate or simply trust the tank and remain still which means the boss can be tanked more centrally and the group can always stay together.</p>
            <p>Four DDs should be assigned for the upstairs mechanic and should choose one teleportation pad each and decide on where they are going to start killing the Spheres.  It is very important to work together when killing the spheres as only one player at a time will get hit with a lightning beam which needs to be kited through and held on each sphere to take down their shield.  Working as a group you should use these beams to remove the spheres shields one by one and then dps them down.  Once the last sphere is dead (or shortly before) everyone should return the their start locations and press all four buttons at the same time.  Be careful not to fall down the holes that appear where you first started until the buttons have been pressed correctly.  Once complete the hole behind your switch will have a cloud/portal effect indicating it is safe to jump into to return to the main fight.  It helps to communicate, use a self heal/shield and have the player that needs to run the furthest count down for the button press as they should be the last to reach theirs.</p>
            <p>For the rest of the fight the group can stack together on one side of the boss until he leaps into you and drops an AoE, then move to the other side and rinse and repeat.  The meteors can be blocked/kited a little to mitigate some of the damage and the conal attack from the boss should be blocked.  Conduits should be called out and killed as a top priority to avoid the huge magicka drain they inflict.</p>
            <p>The off tank should pick up the Centurions as they spawn, keep them away from the group until the Pressure Release has occurred and then bring them to the main boss where they should be quickly killed (before the next Pressure Release).  DDs should focus them as soon as they spawn to get the down quickly.  If the group is more experienced they can be pulled onto the main boss immediately and the group can sidestep the Pressure Release cones.  When the other Centurions spawn in they can be taunted and kited around the room away from the group, this can be done by the off tank or a DD/healer.</p>

        <h2>Boss Three - Archcustodian</h2>
        <p>The next room has a LOT of Refabricated Spiders to deal with while avoiding Whirring Blade Traps which continuously spin and travel along their tracks.  The spiders don't pose a major threat but can explode and charge up others; the blades, however, will stack a nasty bleed on anyone they hit.  Once the room has been cleared you can engage the huge spider boss: The Archcustodian, who is hanging around on the opposite side of the room to the entrance.  The boss itself does not actually perform any attacks but that does not mean it is easy.  Instead I'll highlight the main fight components and what threat the other enemies pose.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Archcustodian</b> - From the start of the fight the Archcustodian will have a shield which will do a huge amount of damage to anyone who touches it and it will reflect projectiles.  The shield can only be removed by having the Archcustodian walk into a shock laser trap which are located at the pylons throughout the room and activated by pulling the nearby levers.  These traps are only active for a few seconds and have a large cooldown but activating them at the right time will remove the bosses shield and stun it for a short time.  Unfortuantely, shortly after a lever has been pulled two enemies will spawn and the boss will speed up slightly.  If you move too far away from the boss you will get targeted with a ranged attack which does a lot of damage.</li>
          <li><b>Calefactors & Dessicators</b> - Calefactors perform a nasty, front conal attack which can one shot most group members while the Dessicators can pull players to them.  Both enemies will apply a bleed with their standard attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spoiler">
          <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler-button">
          <div class="spoiler-head">Strategies</div>
          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>Dealing with the smaller spiders can be done however you want but be careful not to pull the main boss until you are ready.  A safe method for the small spiders is to move from each octagonal pad to the next as a group, stack in the middle and have the tanks taunt the spiders while the group drops all heals and damage in the middle as the spiders come to them.  This allows the group to avoid damage from the blades.  Another method is to send one tank to the right and the rest of the group goes left.  The tanks gather up the spiders and everyone stacks on the last octagonal pad before the boss and burns everything down there (the other tank can pass under the boss without pulling if they are quick).  Some spiders may take a while to reach you and nobody except the tank should attack the spiders until they are in position on the last pad.  It is worth gathering here, generating ultimate and swapping sets (if needed) for the next fight.  You can generate ultimate by blocking attacks so simply holding block and stepping into the blades (you only need to take one tick of damage) will build ultimate.</p>
            <p>For the boss it helps to have one tank to take the adds while the other tank pulls the lever and debuffs the boss.  It really helps to have burst damage here as the windows to damage the boss are quite small.  The main tank can aggro the boss and then move back to the group who should wait by the first level (looking at the map this will be the lever to the north of the boss).  Healers will need to heal everyone through the blade damage.  When the boss is close to the pylons the lever can be pulled, stunning the boss and removing the shield, and the group should drop as much damage as possible on the boss.  As soon as the shield is back up the group should move to the next lever quickly and focus on the adds until the boss is stunned by the next trap.</p>
            <p>After the boss has been stunned for a short time 2 adds will spawn and need to be quickly taunted by the off tank and taken to the new position, turned away from the group and burned down as fast as possible.  If they are still alive when the boss is stunned again they can be taken to the boss to share the damage BUT they need to die before the shield is back up.  If they touch the shield they will get their own shield, reflect player projectiles and not take damage.  If the damage is too low to get the adds down then the group should move together and miss the next switch out (pulling the switch will spawn more adds and speed the boss up).  You shouldn't ever run too far from the boss but focus on the adds and only stop and pull the next lever when the adds are dead.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to handle this fight is to focus on burst damage.  All DDs should switch to burst damage sets and support roles should co-ordinate their ultimates to get as much damage on the boss andf adds as possible during each phase.  Positioning is also important as you will need to heal through the blade damage here.  There are two tracks that run parralel next to the levers, one has a faster blade than the other and this is where you should stand as you will take fewer bleed ticks from this blade (the side the faster blade is on alternates between each lever, if you were stacked on the left for one phase you should stack on the right for the next).</p>

        <h2>Tunnels and Junkyard</h2>
        <p>On the way to the next boss you will have an additional enemy to deal with along with the Calefactors and Dissectors you have already met.  You will still need to be careful of the blade traps and the shock traps that aided you in your last fight will now be against you.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Shock Pylon</b> -The same trap that you used against the Archcustodian.  This trap will turn on and off, allowing you to safely pass, but if you are hit by it you will be slowed and have your magicka drained.</li>
          <li><b>Capacitor</b> - Another robot but this time one is ranged, whereas the Calefactor and Dissector are melee, making it awkward to position.  It will perform an AoE attack on a player which hits hard and will drain magicka.</li>
          <li><b>Ruptured Centurion</b> - The larger robots should be handled by a tank and turned away from the group to avoid any cleave damage.  Once they are nearly dead they will revive several Refabricated Arquebuses in the area that perform the same attacks as those previously.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="section" data-description="six">
        <h2>Boss Four - The Refabrication Committee</h2>
        <p>This boss fight consists of three separate enemies, the Reducer (left), Reclaimer (middle) and Reactor (right).  Each one has its own mechanics which require decent co-ordination and movement from the tanks to deal with along with prioritising which targets to DPS and burst damage where required.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Reducer</b> - Melee boss that performs a heavy attack (Clash) which does a lot of damage and will one shot anyone when it is enraged. Swings its sword to fire off three fire AoEs that move around the room and put a burning DoT on anyone they touch (Fire Whirl).</li>
          <li><b>Reactor</b> - Similarly to the Reducer, another melee boss whos heavy attack (Clash) hits hard and will one shot if the boss is enraged.  Slams its sword into the ground and AoEs will pop up around the room with hands bursting out of them, grabbing hold of anyone caught inside (Grasping Limbs).</li>
          <li><b>Reclaimer</b> - Static boss that has a shield that will do a lot of damage to anyone that touches it.  Throughout the fight this boss will target random players with a shock AoE that does damage and drains magicka and summon Ruined Factotums; smaller mechanical enemies that slowly walk towards the Reclaimer.  Once these reach the Reclaimer they will become "charged" and jump on a random player and explode (Catastrophic Discharge) doing a lot of damage.  The summon is indicated by the Reclaimer shooting shock balls up into the air that land all around the arena.</li>
          <li><b>Enrage Mechanics</b> - When the bosses are close together they become linked by a shock beam.  This beam behaves similarly to the first boss, enraging the bosses that are linked and the beam itself does a lot of damage to anyone caught in it.  Additionally, when each boss reaches specific health thresholds throughout the fight they will automatically enrage (these are 69%, 39% and 19%) and to remove this enrage all three bosses need to be brought together.  Once the enrage is dropped the bosses will be stunned for a short time before the re-activate.</li>
          <li><b>Overheating & Overloading</b> - Throughout the fight the Reducer will overheat and the Reactor will overload, this will always happen at the same time and their respective tanks will see balls (bubbles) shoot up from the boss and hit them repeatedly.  If either tank takes ten consecutive hits from these balls, from the same boss, they will die.</li>
          <li><b>Execute</b> - After the last stun phase (below 19% health) all of the above mechanics will continue as explained but there will be an additional danger.  More Ruined Factotums will start appearing around the edge of the arena, limiting your space to work with and exploding after a short time killing anyone close to them.  Your arena will get smaller and smaller during this phase with more Ruined Factotums appearing closer to the middle.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spoiler">
          <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler-button">
          <div class="spoiler-head">Strategies</div>
          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>When the fight starts there is a short window of opportunity to lay down some damage on all three bosses before they start to link up and enrage.  If you want to take advantage of this then tanks need to quickly pull one outer boss each onto the middle boss and everyone should drop as much AoE damage as possible.  Ideally before they enrage (after five seconds or so) the tanks should pull their respective boss towards the edge of opposite sides of the room.  The DDs and healers should split up so there is equal damage and healing for both groups and everyone can focus these two bosses (Reducer and Reactor).</p>
            <p>Tanks should pay attention to the heavy attacks as these will need to be blocked/dodged always (if the bosses are enraged they will need to be dodged) and look out for the overcharge mechanic.  When they see the balls shooting from their boss they should call to switch bosses, quickly move/charge to and taunt the opposite boss.  Ideally the bosses will not move much at all during this swap but the tanks will both have the other boss and can carry on, swapping everytime this mechanic happens.</p>
            <p>Someone should keep an eye on the Reclaimer and call when it is summoning the Factotums which should then be killed immediately before they can reach the middle.  Additionally, each groups respective bosses health should be watched as you want to only enrage the bosses when all of them are at a similar health percentage.  It's advised to aim for a few percent above the threshold on the side bosses before shifting focus onto the central boss and when all bosses are around 72% the tanks can bring them into the middle where they can be quickly pushed to the 69% threshold, enraged and immediately stunned.  This stun phase is the time to drop high damaging AoEs and ultimates but the tanks can return to their side positions immediately after the stun to pull the bosses away from each other as soon as they re-activate.</p>
            <p>This repeats until the last stun phase 19% at which point the edges of the arena are no longer safe so tanks will need to find a safe position to take their respective bosses to.  It is advised that the group quickly burns down the middle boss first to avoid any additional Factotums spawning and then the side bosses can be pulled back into the middle, one by one, to be killed.</p>
            <p>Communication on this fight is crucial, specifically from the tanks, as they will need to repeatedly swap their bosses and coordinate bringing the bosses into the middle together.  That means that if the call is made to move to the middle and the Reactor starts channeling its Grasping Limbs attack then the other tank will need to know to hold off running into the middle until it is finished.</p>

        <h2>Final Boss - Assembly General</h2>
        <p>On huge robot.  This big boy won't be moved by anyone but he will change positions at set times during the fight.  There's a lot going on here and a lot of different things out to kill you so healers will need to be on their toes while you learn it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Stomp</b> - The boss crashes his LEFT foot into the group knocking anyone nearby flying backwards unless they are blocking.</li>
          <li><b>Bombard</b> - Meteors will continuously rain down on members of the group causing a fair amount of damage.</li>
          <li><b>Toxic Coolant</b> - When the boss is at the end of any of the four corridors there will always be poison directly behind him.  This poison hits extremely hard and nobody can survive it for long.  When the boss moves to the middle this poison will spread along the edges of all four corridors.</li>
          <li><b>Sawblade & Enkindle</b> - The bosses left arm will shoot fire and the right arm will attempt to cut through the group.  These arms will first target anyone on their respective platforms but if there is nobody there they will target the tank/group in front of the boss.</li>
          <li><b>Calefactors & Capacitors</b> - The same enemies you have met previously.  These will spawn in at set intervals in the fight in pairs (one of each add) within a few percent health of each other so you will have four of these adds to deal with in each phase (90% & 87%, 70% & 67%, 50% & 47%, 30% & 27%).  The Calefactors will spawn on the platform under the bosses right arm while the Capacitors will spawn on the platform under the bosses left arm.</li>
          <li><b>Tactical Facsimiles</b> - Every player death will spawn one of these robots and it will replicate that players abilities (depending on class).</li>
          <li><b>Feedback</b> - When the bosses arms are destroyed and his health reaches 85% he will walk to the middle of the room, shield and recharge; allowing him to re-grow his limbs (this happens at 65% and 45% also).  While he is shielded like this, any damage done to him will be reflected back onto the group.  During this time four terminals will pop up, one at the end of each corridor, which will contribute to a large, unavoidable attack (Terminal Feedback) which is enhanced by each terminal that is still alive once the boss has finished recharging.  While the boss is in the centre of the room poison will rise out of all of the vents lining the edges of the corridors, the ramps and higher platforms will be electrified and anyone inside either of these areas will take large amounts of damage.</li>
          <li><b>Whirring Blade</b> - The tracks running up the centre of each corridor will contain a spinning blade trap exactly the same as those you faced previously.  Beware of this hitting you too many times as the bleed stacks can be deadly.</li>
          <li><b>Titanic Smash</b> - The boss smacks whoever has aggro far away from himself.  This can prove to be deadly in combination with the next attack.</li>
          <li><b>Quake</b> - If the player with aggro of the boss is too far away (while the boss is not recharging or in execute) the boss jumps into the air and slams into the ground damaging the entire group and knocking them down.  If this happens three times it will kill the whole group.</li>
          <li><b>Execute</b> - At 25% the boss will return to the centre of the room for the final time.  Each corridor will fill with poisonous gas and the platforms will become electrified causing huge amounts of damage to players in the area.  The centre square of the arena is the only "safe" place to stand.  During execute the boss will repeatedly drop missiles on all group members which will cause damage in an AoE around them (Seeker Projectiles); this damage can splash onto other players as well.  Each time a player dies during this phase the damage of these missiles will increase for all remaining players.</li>
          <li><b>Boss Movement</b> - The boss will always move to the centre of the room at the same times, dictated by his health percentage (85%, 65%, 45%, 25%).  When the boss finishes recharging he will always walk down the same corridors in a set pattern.  If we are facing where the boss spawns (exit) then after 85% the boss will head to the opposite corridor (entrance), at 65% he will head to the right side and at 45% he will head for the opposite side again (left).  Knowing this allows you to plan your movement for killing the terminals to better align yourself for the next phase.</li>

          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>I'll cover two approaches to this fight that are commonly used.  The first is a safer approach and the second is a more optimised but riskier tactic that will be harder with lower DPS.  A couple of things are common for both approaches:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each group member should be assigned a position in the centre square before starting so you are not stacked up on top of each other.  We typically put two DDs at the end of each of the blade tracks, healers on opposite corners and tanks on the other corners.  Remember your positions and get there as soon as possible in execute.</li>
              <li>Only two terminals need to be killed to avoid a one-shot from Terminal Feedback and organising which terminals you will kill will help you stay together as a group.  Typically we would opt to always turn right when navigating the corridors.</li>
              <li>In execute everyone should stick to their role and trust the others; there needs to be enough damage here as your healers will not be able to sustain indefinitely.  Tanks can supply additional healing with Echoing Vigor and Healing Orbs but DDs should focus on parsing on the boss here rather than shielding etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
              <li>The whole group, excluding the main tank, positions themselves directly underneath the bosses left arm (fire) up on the platform to the right (as you face the boss).  The main tank taunts the boss and stands directly in front of him, blocking the Stomp of his left foot and tanking the damage from the blades of his right arm.  The group damages the boss until 90% and then takes damage off the boss (you may need to focus the boss a little more to push him to 87% but usually DoTs will accomplish this, you do not want to push the boss to 85% yet) and focuses on the adds which can be picked up by the off tank and taken to the corner of the platform towards the centre of the room.  This will allow the healers to keep an eye on the group and main tank but keep damage off of the boss.  Once the adds are dead the group can push the boss to 85% forcing him to the middle.  The group will need to jump down to the main tank immediately after this and can focus their damage where the boss was positioned as a terminal will pop up here.  Once this terminal is down the group should move together to another terminal (it makes sense to turn right as you will be in position for the next boss phase) and burn it down.  Here you can stay together and stay alive making sure you are away from the edges (poison) and healing through the blades and meteors.  Make sure that nobody is attacking the boss during this phase as damage is reflected (this includes pets)!
              Once the boss starts to move to the new position the group can once again move up to the platform under his left arm and repeat this process.  In execute (25%) the group should move to their positions quickly and burn the boss down before they get killed.  If there are adds still alive you can ease damage on the boss before 25% to kill them as you did previously.  Otherwise the tank can take them to his corner in execute and play with them there.</li>
              <li>The group stacks directly behind the main tank and makes sure to block the stomp of the bosses left foot.  One DD or a healer starts up on the platfrom below the bosses left arm (fire) and positions themselves directly underneath the arm to avoid taking damage from the fire.  The off tank takes position on the platform under the bosses right arm and kites it around waiting for the adds to spawn.  The group keeps up damage on the boss, aiming to push from 90%-87% veru quickly to spawn in the adds closely together.  The off tank lets the melee adds run down to the group (they will nearly always aggro someone in the group) and the main tank picks these up.  The off tank taunts the adds on the opposite platform and positions themselves towards the top of the ramp leading to the boss, this should force the adds to run down the ramp behind the boss on their side to get line of sight.  Once they are down the ramp the boss should be at 85% and moving towards the middle, the adds are grouped up close to the terminal and the group can drop all of their damage to burn down everything together.  Here you can either split off some DDs with a healer to kill another terminal or all move as one group (this can depends a little on group DPS).  This can be repeated for each phase and execute remains the same as the previous strategy.</li>
