        <h2>The Bridge (and first trash packs)</h2>
        <p>After crossing the bridge you will be met with multiple waves of smaller enemies.  None of these are significant but there are a lot of them to deal with before moving on.</p>
        <div class="spoiler">
          <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler-button">
          <div class="spoiler-head">Strategies</div>
          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>Typically, the group stacks at the start of the bridge, mounts up and tries to move as one unit all the way to the last pillar on your left where you can line of sight the enemies.  You can choose to handle these in waves on foot, having your tank group them up and you DPS burn them down.  The advantage of running behind the pillar is that the mobs will gather themselves and is altogether a faster approach.  You will have enemies on both sides of the pillar (facing back towards the bridge); your tank/s should be letting the melee enemies come to the group and pulling in the archers allowing your DPS and healers to focus everything in on place: where you are stackd.</p>

        <h2>Notable Enemies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Destroyers</b> - Melee enemies with two-handed weapons that carry banners (an indicator they are "elite" enemies).  They do fair damage, which can cleave, and have a frontal cone attack which knocks group members down.</li>
          <li><b>Flame-Shapers</b> - Ranged, bannered enemies equipped with an inferno staff.  These will perform an interruptible channeled attack which shoots fireballs at multiple members of the group.</li>
          <li><b>War Priests</b> - Barely notable but the last of the bannered enemies here.  They are melee enemies with a snare and knockdown ability but do little damage.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spoiler">
          <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler-button">
          <div class="spoiler-head">Strategies</div>
          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>Your tank/s need to taunt and turn the Destroyers and War Priests away from the group.  None of the bannered enemies can be pulled but all but the Flame-Shapers are melee so can be easily grouped with a ranged taunt without turning them to face the group.  The Flame-Shapers should be interrupted as a priority, the tank will have plenty to deal with here so the group should spread out a little and be ready to interrupt.</p>
            <p><b>Tip:</b> After the first wave of enemies you are faced with five Flame-Shapers.  If you get one tank to taunt all five and run along the wall left of the gate there is a hole in the floor that can be used to line of sight the enemies.  While the tank is doing this, other group members will need to make sure the enemies are interrupted but they will all move to a nice stack if done correctly</p>

        <h2>Boss One - Ra Kotu</h2>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/trials/hrc/ra-kotu.jpg" alt="Boss One - Ra Kotu" />
        <p>A huge air atronach that spawns in with three additional enemies and is typically pulled immediately.</p>
        <p>His notable attacks are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Gusts of wind</b> - Small red AoEs that will lock on to and follow a single group member.  The circle does a small amount of damage to anyone inside and can quickly switch targets.  A single group member can get targeted by multiple gusts at a time.</li>
          <li><b>Heavy Attack</b> - Indicated by the usual "yellow sparks" the boss wraps his arms around his body and unleashes a powerful attack on whoever has aggro.</li>
          <li><b>Six Sword Assault</b> - The boss throws out four large AoEs in diagonal directions (his "corners") that return the same way and deal damage to anyone in their path.</li>
          <li><b>Sword Swirl</b> - At 35% (and at regular intervals thereafter if the fight goes on for a while) the boss will form a large AoE around him and continuously spin with his swords dealing large amounts of damage to any group member caught inside.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After defeating Ra Kotu the gate he came out of will be accessible. When six group members go inside the gate will close and the other six are locked out.  To the right is another door that will now be open and the remaining group members can proceed through here. You may wish to organise your group before proceeding.</p>
        <div class="spoiler">
          <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler-button">
          <div class="spoiler-head">Strategies</div>
          <div class="spoiler-body">
            <p>When the fight starts the tank needs to taunt, turn the boss away from the group and be ready to block the heavy attack.  The group can spread out a little (just a few steps, not so far away that your healers can't reach you!) from each other to avoid stacking multiple gusts in one place.  If you have enough ranged DPS then it is advised to stay more directly behind the boss rather than to the left or right to avoid additional damage from the Six Sword Assault.  All of this damage can be healed through, however, but stacking multiple effects can make it more stressful.</p>
            <p>The mechanic that causes issues is the Sword Swirl at 35%.  When the boss is approaching this health percentage take a few steps back to ensure you do not get hit by it.  Most tanks will be able to block and be healed through the damage (if not, you can kite the boss around during this attack) but other group members will not survive.  Once this attack has started you will see more of them if the fight lasts a while so try to maintain a ranged position.  If you are melee be ready to get out of the circle as quickly as possible</p>

      <div class="section" data-description="left">
        <h2>Left Route</h2>
        <p>Your progress here is controlled by the other group as they will have access to levers which open the gates blocking your route.  You will meet mostly the same enemies here with two additions (see below) but many of them will keep respawning within an area until the other group have finished their section and unlocked the gate for you to move on.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Gargoyles</b> - Melee enemies who hit pretty damn hard.  They have a large frontal cone attack (breath/shout) which will turn anyone caught in it to stone and an AoE ground slam attack which will do a lot of damage to anyone inside the circle around them.</li>
          <li><b>Welwa</b> - An introduction to the enemies you'll see when facing the boss on this side.  They perform a rear kick attack which does moderate damage in a cone behind them.</li>

        <p>An archer that specialises in ranged attacks and controls welwa companions who aid him in battle.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Release Flame</b> - A flame arrow will be shot towards a group member which hits the ground and splits into four flame trails, spreading out in different directions from the point of impact.</li>
          <li><b>Teleport</b> - The boss will "jump" away and reappear elsewhere in the arena, looking for the ranged advantage.</li>
          <li><b>Armored Welwas</b> - A more fierce version of the welwas you faced previously.  They hit a bit harder and will be summoned continuously throughout the fight (if the fight lasts a long time you will have many of these to deal with).  After being alive for some time these will enrage, growing larger and hit a lot harder.  Any welwas that die during this battle will be resurrected by the boss.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Impulse</b> - An AoE ability that forms beneath the bosses feet and does a lot of damage to anyone caught inside when it reaches its full size.</li>

          <li><b>Inferno</b> - The same interruptible attack that the flame-shapers do; a channeled ability that shoots fireballs at random group members.</li>
          <li><b>Fiery Deception</b> - The boss splits into four, three of which are clones of himself.  Each will spawn in the same location each time and mimic the boss; performing the Impulse and Inferno ability as described above.

        <h2>Boss Three - The Warrior</h2>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/trials/hrc/warrior.jpg" alt="Boss Three - The Warrior" />
        <p>Despite being one of the oldest, this is still one of the hardest hitting bosses in the game.  The Warrior puts a lot of pressure on the tank, requires full group co-ordination and a fair bit of effort from your healers to complete it.  There are two large circles, to the left and right of the boss as you enter the room. The left increases health recovery and the right increases damage done for anyone standing inside (including the enemies). These are generated by the statues on their respective side which will be destroyed one by one during the fight (left at 85%, right at 70%).  The boss will also destroy any chests around the room at 35% when he does his Shehai Storm mechanic so be sure to loot these before you start the fight!</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Channeled Swipes</b> - A series of heavy slashes that each do a lot of damage to whoever has aggro and to anyone standing close enough in front of him.</li>
          <li><b>Shield Throw</b> - The boss will target a random member of the group, turn to them and throw out his shield like a boomerang. The shield will hit for a lot of damage and knock down anyone not blocking; it hits on the way out and on the return.</li>
          <li><b>Leap</b> - The boss leaps to any group member that is far enough away from him and does a lot of damage on impact.  This mechanic only happens if someone is standing far away, however.  He will sometimes leap to the statues when he destroys them or leap back from the statues once they have been destroyed.</li>
          <li><b>Cleave</b> - A front-facing, conal, cleave attack which does a lot of damage.  Towards execute this will be done after each shield throw and typically will be in the direction that he threw his shield.</li>
          <li><b>Shehai Storm</b> - The boss points his sword upwards and channels an attack that hits everyone in the group.  Each group member will get a pulsing red circle under their feet that moves with them and does damage with every pulse.  Overlapping with another group members circle will cause you to take damage from their AoE as well.</li>
          <li><b>Adds</b> - Destroyers and Flame-shapers are summoned at different times during the fight.  These act exactly as described previously and will be destroyed at 35% when the boss triggers the initial explosion of his Shehai Storm mechanic (Shehai Shockwave).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hardmode</h2>
        <p>Activated by destroying all three of the statues found outside the door to the final boss room and cannot be undone (as with later content), once activated you will need to kill the boss on hardmode or die trying.  As with almost every other hardmode in the game, expect the boss to have more health and some of the above attacks to do more damage.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Stone Form</b> - A random group member will become encased in stone and unable to use any abilities.  While encased they will receive a unique synergy "Destructive Outbreak" which releases them from the stone but also does huge damage in a large circle around them.</li>
          <li><b>Gargoyles</b> - In the area around the boss there are twelve statues, each containing a gargoyle.  The statues will start to come to life during the fight giving your group additional enemies to deal with.  They work exactly the same as described previously.</li>
        </ul>
