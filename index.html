  This site has been created as a passion project as a reference for all of the mechanics and key abilities for all group content in The Elder Scrolls Online.
  It is designed to be used more as a reference if your group is struggling with a particular mechanic, in order to devise a strategy for dealing with it yu need to understand how it works.
  There will be a hidden "spoiler" section included at the bottom of each section detailing one approach to dealing with that particular stage (likely one of many) but I'd advise you to work with the group you have and adjust as needed.
  Or better yet, ignore this section altogether and come up with your own strategy as a group.

  All ability names are taken directly from ESO log files and so you should be able to get a clear description for any mechanic that may be giving you difficulty by simply navigating to the correct section and performing a search.
