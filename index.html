<p>This site is a passion project, created as a reference for all of the mechanics found group content in The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>It is meant to be used more as a reference in order to devise a strategy for dealing with a particular mechanic yourself or your group are struggling with rather than a "how to" guide for the content</p>
<p>A "spoiler" section will be included at the bottom of each section detailing one possible approach to dealing with that particular stage but I'd advise you to work with the group you have and adjust as needed or, better yet, ignore this section altogether and come up with your own strategy as a group.</p>
<p>All ability names are taken directly from ESO log files and so you should be able to get a clear description for any mechanic that may be giving you difficulty by simply navigating to the correct section and performing a search.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
