<p>This site is a passion project created as a reference for all of the mechanics to be found for group content in The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>It is meant to be used more as a reference guide, used to devise a strategy for dealing with a particular mechanic than a "how to" guide for the content; there are plenty of them out there already.</p>
<p>A "spoiler" section will be included at the bottom of each page, however, detailing at least one possible approach to dealing with that particular fight but I'd advise you to work with your group and adjust things as needed or, better yet, ignore this section altogether and come up with your own strategy.</p>
<p>I have attempted to grab all ability names directly from esolog.com files so if, for example, a particular attack is causing issues (shown in the in-game Death Recap perhaps) you should be able to search for that ability and gain some insights.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
