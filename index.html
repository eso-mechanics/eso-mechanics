<p>This site is a passion project created as a comprehensive guide for the group mechanics in The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>It is meant to be used as a reference guide, in order to devise a strategy for dealing with particular mechanics rather than a "how to" guide for the content; there are plenty of them out there already.</p>
<p>A "spoiler" section will always be included, however, detailing at least one possible approach to dealing with that particular fights mechanics but I'd advise you to work with your group and adjust things as needed or, better yet, ignore this section altogether and come up with your own strategy.</p>
<p>I have attempted to grab all ability names directly from esolog.com files so if, for example, a particular attack is causing issues (shown in the in-game Death Recap or your log file) you should be able to search for that ability and gain some insight into how it works and how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
